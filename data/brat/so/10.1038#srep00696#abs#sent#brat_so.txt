Genomes of surface isolates of Alteromonas macleodii: the life of a widespread marine opportunistic copiotroph
Alteromonas macleodii is a marine gammaproteobacterium with widespread distribution in temperate or tropical waters.
We describe three genomes of isolates from surface waters around Europe (Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea) and compare them with a previously described deep Mediterranean isolate (AltDE) that belongs to a widely divergent clade.
The surface isolates are quite similar, the most divergent being the Black Sea (BS11) isolate.
The genomes contain several genomic islands with different gene content.
The recruitment of very similar genomic fragments from metagenomes in different locations indicates that the surface clade is globally abundant with little effect of geography, even the AltDE and the BS11 genomes recruiting from surface samples in open ocean locations.
The finding of CRISPR protospacers of AltDE in a lysogenic phage in the Atlantic (English Channel) isolate illustrates a flow of genetic material among these clades and a remarkably wide distribution of this phage.
