Bacterial structures and ecosystem functions in glaciated floodplains: contemporary states and potential future shifts
Glaciated alpine floodplains are responding quickly to climate change through shrinking ice masses.
Given the expected future changes in their physicochemical environment, we anticipated variable shifts in structure and ecosystem functioning of hyporheic microbial communities in proglacial alpine streams, depending on present community characteristics and landscape structures.
We examined microbial structure and functioning during different hydrologic periods in glacial (kryal) streams and, as contrasting systems, groundwater-fed (krenal) streams.
Three catchments were chosen to cover an array of landscape features, including interconnected lakes, differences in local geology and degree of deglaciation.
Community structure was assessed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and microbial function by potential enzyme activities.
We found each catchment to contain a distinct bacterial community structure and different degrees of separation in structure and functioning that were linked to the physicochemical properties of the waters within each catchment.
Bacterial communities showed high functional plasticity, although achieved by different strategies in each system.
Typical kryal communities showed a strong linkage of structure and function that indicated a major prevalence of specialists, whereas krenal sediments were dominated by generalists.
With the rapid retreat of glaciers and therefore altered ecohydrological characteristics, lotic microbial structure and functioning are likely to change substantially in proglacial floodplains in the future.
The trajectory of these changes will vary depending on contemporary bacterial community characteristics and landscape structures that ultimately determine the sustainability of ecosystem functioning.
