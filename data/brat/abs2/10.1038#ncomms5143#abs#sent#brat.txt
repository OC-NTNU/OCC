Silicate deposition during decomposition of cyanobacteria may promote export of picophytoplankton to the deep ocean
Marine particles transport organic matter through the water column to the sediment where the organic matter can be buried.
This pathway is one of the few natural removal mechanisms of CO2 from the atmosphere over geological time.
Picophytoplankton, major primary producers in the ocean, have until recently been thought unimportant regarding particle transport.
Here we provide evidence that silicate is deposited on extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) associated with decomposing picophytoplankton.
We also find that Si is enriched in a previously unexplored group of marine particles (called micro-blebs) from the deep-water column.
The surprising similarity in morphology and composition between EPS-Si and micro-blebs suggests that EPS-Si may be a precursor of micro-blebs observed in the deep ocean.
This previously unexplored source of silicon may be important to silicon cycling and may further enhance export of picophytoplankton to the deep ocean.
