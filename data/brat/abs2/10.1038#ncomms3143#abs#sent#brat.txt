Distinct iron isotopic signatures and supply from marine sediment dissolution
Oceanic iron inputs must be traced and quantified to learn how they affect primary productivity and climate.
Chemical reduction of iron in continental margin sediments provides a substantial dissolved flux to the oceans, which is isotopically lighter than the crust, and so may be distinguished in seawater from other sources, such as wind-blown dust.
However, heavy iron isotopes measured in seawater have recently led to the proposition of another source of dissolved iron from 'non-reductive' dissolution of continental margins.
Here we present the first pore water iron isotope data from a passive-tectonic and semi-arid ocean margin (South Africa), which reveals a smaller and isotopically heavier flux of dissolved iron to seawater than active-tectonic and dysoxic continental margins.
These data provide in situ evidence of non-reductive iron dissolution from a continental margin, and further show that geological and hydro-climatic factors may affect the amount and isotopic composition of iron entering the ocean.
