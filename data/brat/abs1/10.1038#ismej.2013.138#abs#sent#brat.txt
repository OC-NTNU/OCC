Host-specific adaptation governs the interaction of the marine diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia and their microbiota
The association of phytoplankton with bacteria is ubiquitous in nature and the bacteria that associate with different phytoplankton species are very diverse.
The influence of these bacteria in the physiology and ecology of the host and the evolutionary forces that shape the relationship are still not understood.
In this study, we used the Pseudo-nitzschia-microbiota association to determine (1) if algal species with distinct domoic acid (DA) production are selection factors that structures the bacterial community, (2) if host-specificity and co-adaptation govern the association, (3) the functional roles of isolated member of microbiota on diatom-hosts fitness and (4) the influence of microbiota in changing the phenotype of the diatom hosts with regards to toxin production.
Analysis of the pyrosequencing-derived 16S rDNA data suggests that the three tested species of Pseudo-nitzschia, which vary in toxin production, have phylogenetically distinct bacterial communities, and toxic Pseudo-nitzschia have lower microbial diversity than non-toxic Pseudo-nitzschia.
Transplant experiments showed that isolated members of the microbiota are mutualistic to their native hosts but some are commensal or parasitic to foreign hosts, hinting at co-evolution between partners.
Moreover, Pseudo-nitzschia host can gain protection from algalytic bacteria by maintaining association with its microbiota.
Pseudo-nitzschia also exhibit different phenotypic expression with regards to DA production, and this depends on the bacterial species with which the host associates.
Hence, the influences of the microbiota on diatom host physiology should be considered when studying the biology and ecology of marine diatoms.
