Mg2+ as an indicator of nutritional status in marine bacteria
Cells maintain an osmotic pressure essential for growth and division, using organic compatible solutes and inorganic ions.
Mg2+, which is the most abundant divalent cation in living cells, has not been considered an osmotically important solute.
Here we show that under carbon limitation or dormancy native marine bacterial communities have a high cellular concentration of Mg2+ (370-940 mM) and a low cellular concentration of Na+ (50-170 mM).
With input of organic carbon, the average cellular concentration of Mg2+ decreased 6-12-fold, whereas that of Na+ increased ca 3-4-fold.
The concentration of chlorine, which was in the range of 330-1200 mM, and was the only inorganic counterion of quantitative significance, balanced and followed changes in the concentration of Mg2++Na+.
In an osmotically stable environment, like seawater, any major shift in bacterial osmolyte composition should be related to shifts in growth conditions, and replacing organic compatible solutes with inorganic solutes is presumably a favorable strategy when growing in carbon-limited condition.
A high concentration of Mg2+ in cells may also serve to protect and stabilize macromolecules during periods of non-growth and dormancy.
Our results suggest that Mg2+ has a major role as osmolyte in marine bacteria, and that the [Mg2+]/[Na+] ratio is related to its physiological condition and nutritional status.
Bacterial degradation is a main sink for dissolved organic carbon in the ocean, and understanding the mechanisms limiting bacterial activity is therefore essential for understanding the oceanic C-cycle.
The [Mg2+]/[Na+]-ratio in cells may provide a physiological proxy for the transitions between C-limited and mineral nutrient-limited bacterial growth in the ocean's surface layer.
