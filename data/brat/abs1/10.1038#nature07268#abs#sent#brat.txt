Major viral impact on the functioning of benthic deep-sea ecosystems
Viruses are the most abundant biological organisms of the world's oceans.
Viral infections are a substantial source of mortality in a range of organisms--including autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton--but their impact on the deep ocean and benthic biosphere is completely unknown.
Here we report that viral production in deep-sea benthic ecosystems worldwide is extremely high, and that viral infections are responsible for the abatement of 80% of prokaryotic heterotrophic production.
Virus-induced prokaryotic mortality increases with increasing water depth, and beneath a depth of 1,000 m nearly all of the prokaryotic heterotrophic production is transformed into organic detritus.
The viral shunt, releasing on a global scale ~0.37-0.63 gigatonnes of carbon per year, is an essential source of labile organic detritus in the deep-sea ecosystems.
This process sustains a high prokaryotic biomass and provides an important contribution to prokaryotic metabolism, allowing the system to cope with the severe organic resource limitation of deep-sea ecosystems.
Our results indicate that viruses have an important role in global biogeochemical cycles, in deep-sea metabolism and the overall functioning of the largest ecosystem of our biosphere.
