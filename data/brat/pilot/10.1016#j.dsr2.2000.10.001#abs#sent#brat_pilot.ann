#4	AnnotatorNotes E20	Like "export"/"import", the direction of change is relative, so use Change. Agent role can not be annotated because 'phytoplankton' is not a change.
#1	AnnotatorNotes E13	Implied change: change in iron causes *change* in growth rate
#2	AnnotatorNotes E7	'higher' interpreted as increase in this context
#5	AnnotatorNotes T11	'growth rate of X' (not Increase) is different from 'growth of X' (= Increase)
#6	AnnotatorNotes E2	Mark whole phrase as trigger, because "have effect (on)" is multi-word expression. We cannot leave out 'substantial'.
#8	AnnotatorNotes E18	Implict change: 'photoreduction of iron' is a process of change without a clear Theme. Only annotated because it is involved in a causal relation.
#9	AnnotatorNotes E6	Prepostion 'by' part of trigger, because it is not verbal particle but only part of passive construction.
