Magnitude of oceanic nitrogen fixation influenced by the nutrient uptake ratio of phytoplankton
The elemental stoichiometry of sea water and particulate organic matter is remarkably similar.
This observation led Redfield to hypothesize that the oceanic ratio of nitrate to phosphate is controlled by the remineralization of phytoplankton biomass.
The Redfield ratio is used universally to quantitatively link the marine nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in numerous biogeochemical applications.
Yet, empirical and theoretical studies show that the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in phytoplankton varies greatly with taxa and growth conditions.
Here we present a dynamic five-box ecosystem model showing that non-Redfield utilization of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus by non-nitrogen-fixing phytoplankton controls the magnitude and distribution of nitrogen fixation.
In our simulations, systems dominated by rapidly growing phytoplankton with low nitrogen to phosphorus uptake ratios reduce the phosphorus available for nitrogen fixation.
In contrast, in systems dominated by slow-growing phytoplankton with high nitrogen to phosphorus uptake ratios nitrogen deficits are enhanced, and nitrogen fixation is promoted.
We show that estimates of nitrogen fixation are up to fourfold too high when non-Redfield uptake stoichiometries are ignored.
We suggest that the relative abundance of fast- and slow-growing phytoplankton controls the amount of new nitrogen added to the ocean.
