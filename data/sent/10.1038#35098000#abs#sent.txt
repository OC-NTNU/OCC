Catastrophic shifts in ecosystems
All ecosystems are exposed to gradual changes in climate, nutrient loading, habitat fragmentation or biotic exploitation.
Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way.
However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state.
Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state.
This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.
