Effect of aquaculture on world fish supplies
Global production of farmed fish and shellfish has more than doubled in the past 15 years.
Many people believe that such growth relieves pressure on ocean fisheries, but the opposite is true for some types of aquaculture.
Farming carnivorous species requires large inputs of wild fish for feed.
Some aquaculture systems also reduce wild fish supplies through habitat modification, wild seedstock collection and other ecological impacts.
On balance, global aquaculture production still adds to world fish supplies; however, if the growing aquaculture industry is to sustain its contribution to world fish supplies, it must reduce wild fish inputs in feed and adopt more ecologically sound management practices.
