Vertical distribution of microbial communities in a perennially stratified Arctic lake with saline, anoxic bottom waters
Meromictic lakes are useful biogeochemical models because of their stratified chemical gradients and separation of redox reactions down the water column.
Perennially ice-covered meromictic lakes are particularly stable, with long term constancy in their density profiles.
Here we sampled Lake A, a deep meromictic lake at latitude 83degreesN in High Arctic Canada.
Sampling was before (May) and after (August) an unusual ice-out event during the warm 2008 summer.
We determined the bacterial and archaeal community composition by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene tag-pyrosequencing.
Both prokaryote communities were stratified by depth and the Bacteria differed between dates, indicating locally driven selection processes.
We matched taxa to known taxon-specific biogeochemical functions and found a close correspondence between the depth of functional specialists and chemical gradients.
These results indicate a rich microbial diversity despite the extreme location, with pronounced vertical structure in taxonomic and potential functional composition, and with community shifts during ice-out.
