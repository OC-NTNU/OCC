Mixed responses of tropical Pacific fisheries and aquaculture to climate change
Pacific Island countries have an extraordinary dependence on fisheries and aquaculture.
Maintaining the benefits from the sector is a difficult task, now made more complex by climate change.
Here we report how changes to the atmosphere-ocean are likely to affect the food webs, habitats and stocks underpinning fisheries and aquaculture across the region.
We found winners and losers--tuna are expected to be more abundant in the east and freshwater aquaculture and fisheries are likely to be more productive.
Conversely, coral reef fisheries could decrease by 20% by 2050 and coastal aquaculture may be less efficient.
We demonstrate how the economic and social implications can be addressed within the sector--tuna and freshwater aquaculture can help support growing populations as coral reefs, coastal fisheries and mariculture decline.
