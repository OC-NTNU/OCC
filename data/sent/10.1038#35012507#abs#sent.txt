Oceanic Cd/P ratio and nutrient utilization in the glacial Southern Ocean
During glacial periods, low atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has been associated with increased oceanic carbon uptake, particularly in the southern oceans.
The mechanism involved remains unclear.
Because ocean productivity is strongly influenced by nutrient levels, palaeo-oceanographic proxies have been applied to investigate nutrient utilization in surface water across glacial transitions.
Here we show that present-day cadmium and phosphorus concentrations in the global oceans can be explained by a chemical fractionation during particle formation, whereby uptake of cadmium occurs in preference to uptake of phosphorus.
This allows the reconstruction of past surface water phosphate concentrations from the cadmium/calcium ratio of planktonic foraminifera.
Results from the Last Glacial Maximum show similar phosphate utilization in the subantarctic to that of today, but much smaller utilization in the polar Southern Ocean, in a model that is consistent with the expansion of glacial sea ice and which can reconcile all proxy records of polar nutrient utilization.
By restricting communication between the ocean and atmosphere, sea ice expansion also provides a mechanism for reduced CO2 release by the Southern Ocean and lower glacial atmospheric CO2.
