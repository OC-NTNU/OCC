Increasing subtropical North Pacific Ocean nitrogen fixation since the Little Ice Age
The North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG) plays a major part in the export of carbon and other nutrients to the deep ocean.
Primary production in the NPSG has increased in recent decades despite a reduction in nutrient supply to surface waters.
It is thought that this apparent paradox can be explained by a shift in plankton community structure from mostly eukaryotes to mostly nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes.
It remains uncertain, however, whether the plankton community domain shift can be linked to cyclical climate variability or a long-term global warming trend.
Here we analyse records of bulk and amino-acid-specific 15N/14N isotopic ratios (delta15N) preserved in the skeletons of long-lived deep-sea proteinaceous corals collected from the Hawaiian archipelago; these isotopic records serve as a proxy for the source of nitrogen-supported export production through time.
We find that the recent increase in nitrogen fixation is the continuation of a much larger, centennial-scale trend.
After a millennium of relatively minor fluctuation, delta15N decreases between 1850 and the present.
The total shift in delta15N of -2 per mil over this period is comparable to the total change in global mean sedimentary delta15N across the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, but it is happening an order of magnitude faster.
We use a steady-state model and find that the isotopic mass balance between nitrate and nitrogen fixation implies a 17 to 27 per cent increase in nitrogen fixation over this time period.
A comparison with independent records suggests that the increase in nitrogen fixation might be linked to Northern Hemisphere climate change since the end of the Little Ice Age.
