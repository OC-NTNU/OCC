The impact of lower sea-ice extent on Arctic greenhouse-gas exchange
In September 2012, Arctic sea-ice extent plummeted to a new record low: two times lower than the 1979-2000 average.
Often, record lows in sea-ice cover are hailed as an example of climate change impacts in the Arctic.
Less apparent, however, are the implications of reduced sea-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean for marine-atmosphere CO2 exchange.
Sea-ice decline has been connected to increasing air temperatures at high latitudes.
Temperature is a key controlling factor in the terrestrial exchange of CO2 and methane, and therefore the greenhouse-gas balance of the Arctic.
Despite the large potential for feedbacks, many studies do not connect the diminishing sea-ice extent with changes in the interaction of the marine and terrestrial Arctic with the atmosphere.
In this Review, we assess how current understanding of the Arctic Ocean and high-latitude ecosystems can be used to predict the impact of a lower sea-ice cover on Arctic greenhouse-gas exchange.
