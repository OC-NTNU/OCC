Emerging patterns of marine nitrogen fixation
Biological N2 fixation is an important part of the marine nitrogen cycle as it provides a source of new nitrogen that can support biological carbon export and sequestration. Research in the past decade has focused on determining the patterns of distribution and abundance of diazotrophs, defining the environmental features leading to these patterns and characterizing the factors that constrain marine N2 fixation overall. In this Review, we describe how variations in the deposition of iron from dust to different ocean basins affects the limiting nutrient for N2 fixation and the distribution of different diazotrophic species. However, many questions remain about marine N2 fixation, including the role of temperature, fixed nitrogen species, CO2 and physical forcing in controlling N2 fixation, as well as the potential for heterotrophic N2 fixation.
