Identifying microorganisms responsible for ecologically significant biogeochemical processes
Throughout evolutionary time, and each day in every habitat throughout the globe, microorganisms have been responsible for maintaining the biosphere. Despite the crucial part that they play in the cycling of nutrients in habitats such as soils, sediments and waters, only rarely have the microorganisms actually responsible for key processes been identified. Obstacles that have traditionally impeded fundamental microbial ecology inquiries are now yielding to technical advancements that have important parallels in medical microbiology. The pace of new discoveries that document ecological processes and their causative agents will no doubt accelerate in the near future, and might assist in ecosystem management.
