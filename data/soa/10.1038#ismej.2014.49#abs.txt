Gammaproteobacterial diazotrophs and nifH gene expression in surface waters of the South Pacific Ocean
In addition to the cyanobacterial N2-fixers (diazotrophs), there is a high nifH gene diversity of non-cyanobacterial groups present in marine environments, yet quantitative information about these groups is scarce. N2 fixation potential (nifH gene expression), diversity and distributions of the uncultivated diazotroph phylotype -24774A11, a putative gammaproteobacterium, were investigated in the western South Pacific Ocean. -24774A11 gene copies correlated positively with diazotrophic cyanobacteria, temperature, dissolved organic carbon and ambient O2 saturation, and negatively with depth, chlorophyll a and nutrients, suggesting that carbon supply, access to light or inhibitory effects of DIN may control -24774A11 abundances. Maximum nifH gene-copy abundance was 2 104l1, two orders of magnitude less than that for diazotrophic cyanobacteria, while the median -24774A11 abundance, 8 102l1, was greater than that for the UCYN-A cyanobacteria, suggesting a more homogeneous distribution in surface waters. The abundance of nifH transcripts by -24774A11 was greater during the night than during the day, and the transcripts generally ranged from 07, but were up to 26 of all nifH transcripts at each station. The ubiquitous presence and low variability of -24774A11 abundances across tropical and subtropical oceans, combined with the consistent nifH expression reported in this study, suggest that -24774A11 could be one of the most important heterotrophic (or photoheterotrophic) diazotrophs and may need to be considered in future N budget estimates and models.
