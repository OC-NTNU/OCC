A short-term sink for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in subtropical mode water of the North Atlantic Ocean

<p>Large-scale features of ocean circulation, such as deep water formation in the northern North Atlantic Ocean<span></span>, are known to regulate the long-term physical uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by moving CO<sub>2</sub>-laden surface waters into the deep ocean. But the importance of CO<sub>2</sub> uptake into water masses that ventilate shallower ocean depths, such as subtropical mode waters<span></span> of the subtropical gyres, are poorly quantified. Here we report that, between 1988 and 2001, dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in subtropical mode waters of the North Atlantic have increased at a rate twice that expected from these waters keeping in equilibrium with increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. This accounts for an extra ∼0.4–2.8 Pg C (1 Pg = 10<span>15</span> g) over this period (that is, about 0.03–0.24 Pg C yr<span>-1</span>), equivalent to ∼3–10% of the current net annual ocean uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> (ref. <span>3</span>). We suggest that the lack of strong winter mixing events, to greater than 300 m in depth, in recent decades is responsible for this accumulation, which would otherwise disturb the mode water layer and liberate accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> back to the atmosphere. However, future climate variability (which influences subtropical mode water formation<span></span>) and changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation<span></span> (leading to a return of deep winter mixing events) may reduce CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation in subtropical mode waters. We therefore conclude that, although CO<sub>2</sub> uptake by subtropical mode waters in the North Atlantic—and possibly elsewhere—does not always represent a long-term CO<sub>2</sub> sink, the phenomenon is likely to contribute substantially to interannual variability in oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake<span></span>.</p>
