Iron and phosphorus co-limit nitrogen fixation in the eastern tropical North Atlantic
</title>
<description>
<p>The role of iron in enhancing phytoplankton productivity in high nutrient, low chlorophyll oceanic regions was demonstrated first through iron-addition bioassay experiments<span></span> and subsequently confirmed by large-scale iron fertilization experiments<span></span>. Iron supply has been hypothesized to limit nitrogen fixation and hence oceanic primary productivity on geological timescales<span></span>, providing an alternative to phosphorus as the ultimate limiting nutrient<span></span>. Oceanographic observations have been interpreted both to confirm and refute this hypothesis<span></span>, but direct experimental evidence is lacking<span></span>. We conducted experiments to test this hypothesis during the <i>Meteor 55</i> cruise to the tropical North Atlantic. This region is rich in diazotrophs<span></span> and strongly impacted by Saharan dust input<span></span>. Here we show that community primary productivity was nitrogen-limited, and that nitrogen fixation was co-limited by iron and phosphorus. Saharan dust addition stimulated nitrogen fixation, presumably by supplying both iron and phosphorus<span></span>. Our results support the hypothesis that aeolian mineral dust deposition promotes nitrogen fixation in the eastern tropical North Atlantic.</p>
