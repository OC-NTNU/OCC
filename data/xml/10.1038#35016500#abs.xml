Effect of aquaculture on world fish supplies
</title>
<description>
<p>Global production of farmed fish and shellfish has more than doubled in
the past 15 years. Many people believe that such growth relieves pressure
on ocean fisheries, but the opposite is true for some types of aquaculture.
Farming carnivorous species requires large inputs of wild fish for feed. Some
aquaculture systems also reduce wild fish supplies through habitat modification,
wild seedstock collection and other ecological impacts. On balance, global
aquaculture production still adds to world fish supplies; however, if the
growing aquaculture industry is to sustain its contribution to world fish
supplies, it must reduce wild fish inputs in feed and adopt more ecologically
sound management practices.</p>
