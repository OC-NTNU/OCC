The polar ocean and glacial cycles in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
</title>
<description>
<p>Global climate and the atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (<span><span></span></span>) are correlated over recent glacial cycles, with lower <span><span></span></span> during ice ages, but the causes of the <span><span></span></span> changes are unknown. The modern Southern Ocean releases deeply sequestered CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. Growing evidence suggests that the Southern Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> ‘leak’ was stemmed during ice ages, increasing ocean CO<sub>2</sub> storage. Such a change would also have made the global ocean more alkaline, driving additional ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. This explanation for lower ice-age <span><span></span></span>, if correct, has much to teach us about the controls on current ocean processes.</p>
