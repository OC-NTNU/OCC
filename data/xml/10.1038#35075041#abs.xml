Phosphorus limitation of nitrogen fixation by <i>Trichodesmium</i> in the central Atlantic Ocean

<description>
<p>Marine fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is believed to be an important source of biologically useful nitrogen to ocean surface waters<span></span>, stimulating productivity of phytoplankton and so influencing the global carbon cycle<span></span>. The majority of nitrogen fixation in tropical waters is carried out by the marine cyanobacterium <i>Trichodesmium</i><span></span>, which supplies more than half of the new nitrogen used for primary production<span></span>. Although the factors controlling marine nitrogen fixation remain poorly understood, it has been thought that nitrogen fixation is limited by iron availability in the ocean<span></span>. This was inferred from the high iron requirement estimated for growth of nitrogen fixing organisms<span></span> and the higher apparent densities of <i>Trichodesmium</i> where aeolian iron inputs are plentiful<span></span>. Here we report that nitrogen fixation rates in the central Atlantic appear to be independent of both dissolved iron levels in sea water and iron content in <i>Trichodesmium</i> colonies. Nitrogen fixation was, instead, highly correlated to the phosphorus content of <i>Trichodesmium</i> and was enhanced at higher irradiance. Furthermore, our calculations suggest that the structural iron requirement for the growth of nitrogen-fixing organisms is much lower than previously calculated<span></span>. Although iron deficiency could still potentially limit growth of nitrogen-fixing organisms in regions of low iron availability—for example, in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean—our observations suggest that marine nitrogen fixation is not solely regulated by iron supply.</p>
