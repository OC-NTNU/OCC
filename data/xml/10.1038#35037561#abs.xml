Effect of iron supply on Southern Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and implications
for glacial atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
</title>
<description>
<p>Photosynthesis by marine phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean, and the associated
uptake of carbon, is thought to be currently limited by the availability of
iron. One implication of this limitation is that a larger
iron supply to the region in glacial times could have stimulated
algal photosynthesis, leading to lower concentrations of atmospheric CO<sub>
2</sub>. Similarly, it has been proposed that artificial iron fertilization
of the oceans might increase future carbon sequestration. Here we report data
from a whole-ecosystem test of the iron-limitation hypothesis in the Southern
Ocean, which show that surface uptake of atmospheric CO<sub>
2</sub> and uptake ratios of silica to carbon by phytoplankton were strongly
influenced by nanomolar increases of iron concentration. We use these results
to inform a model of global carbon and ocean nutrients, forced with atmospheric
iron fluxes to the region derived from the Vostok ice-core
dust record. During glacial periods, predicted magnitudes and timings of atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> changes match ice-core records well. At glacial terminations,
the model suggests that forcing of Southern Ocean biota by iron caused the
initial ∼40 p.p.m. of glacial–interglacial CO<sub>2</sub>
change, but other mechanisms must have accounted for the remaining 40 p.p.m.
increase. The experiment also confirms that modest sequestration of atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> by artificial additions of iron to the Southern Ocean is in
principle possible, although the period and geographical extent over which
sequestration would be effective remain poorly known.</p>
