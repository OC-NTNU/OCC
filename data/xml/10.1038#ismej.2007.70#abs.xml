Phytoplankton carbon fixation gene (RuBisCO) transcripts and air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux in the Mississippi River plume
</title>
<description>
<p>River plumes deliver large quantities of nutrients to oligotrophic oceans, often resulting in significant CO<span>2</span> drawdown. To determine the relationship between expression of the major gene in carbon fixation (large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO) and CO<span>2</span> dynamics, we evaluated <i>rbcL</i> mRNA abundance using novel quantitative PCR assays, phytoplankton cell analyses, photophysiological parameters, and <i>p</i>CO<span>2</span> in and around the Mississippi River plume (MRP) in the Gulf of Mexico. Lower salinity (30–32) stations were dominated by <i>rbcL</i> mRNA concentrations from heterokonts, such as diatoms and pelagophytes, which were at least an order of magnitude greater than haptophytes, α-<i>Synechococcus</i> or high-light <i>Prochlorococcus</i>. However, <i>rbcL</i> transcript abundances were similar among these groups at oligotrophic stations (salinity 34–36). Diatom cell counts and heterokont <i>rbcL</i> RNA showed a strong negative correlation to seawater <i>p</i>CO<span>2</span>. While <i>Prochlorococcus</i> cells did not exhibit a large difference between low and high <i>p</i>CO<span>2</span> water, <i>Prochlorococcus rbcL</i> RNA concentrations had a strong positive correlation to <i>p</i>CO<span>2</span>, suggesting a very low level of RuBisCO RNA transcription among <i>Prochlorococcus</i> in the plume waters, possibly due to their relatively poor carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). These results provide molecular evidence that diatom/pelagophyte productivity is largely responsible for the large CO<span>2</span> drawdown occurring in the MRP, based on the co-occurrence of elevated RuBisCO gene transcript concentrations from this group and reduced seawater <i>p</i>CO<span>2</span> levels. This may partly be due to efficient CCMs that enable heterokont eukaryotes such as diatoms to continue fixing CO<span>2</span> in the face of strong CO<span>2</span> drawdown. Our work represents the first attempt to relate <i>in situ</i> microbial gene expression to contemporaneous CO<span>2</span> flux measurements in the ocean.</p>
