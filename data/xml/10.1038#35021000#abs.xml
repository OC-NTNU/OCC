Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 60 million years

<description>
<p>Knowledge of the evolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
throughout the Earth's history is important for a reconstruction of the links
between climate and radiative forcing of the Earth's surface temperatures.
Although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in the early Cenozoic era
(about 60 Myr ago) are widely believed to have been higher than at
present, there is disagreement regarding the exact carbon dioxide levels,
the timing of the decline and the mechanisms that are most important for the
control of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over geological timescales. Here
we use the boron-isotope ratios of ancient planktonic foraminifer shells to
estimate the pH of surface-layer sea water throughout the past 60 million
years, which can be used to reconstruct atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
We estimate CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of more than 2,000 p.p.m.
for the late Palaeocene and earliest Eocene periods (from about 60 to 52 Myr
ago), and find an erratic decline between 55 and 40 Myr ago that may
have been caused by reduced CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing from ocean ridges, volcanoes
and metamorphic belts and increased carbon burial. Since the early Miocene
(about 24 Myr ago), atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations appear
to have remained below 500 p.p.m. and were more stable than before,
although transient intervals of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction may have occurred
during periods of rapid cooling approximately 15 and 3 Myr ago.</p>
