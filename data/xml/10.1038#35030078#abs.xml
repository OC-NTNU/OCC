Reduced calcification of marine plankton in response to increased atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub>
</title>
<description>
<p>The formation of calcareous skeletons by marine planktonic organisms and
their subsequent sinking to depth generates a continuous rain of calcium carbonate
to the deep ocean and underlying sediments. This is important
in regulating marine carbon cycling and oceanâ€“atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub>
exchange. The present rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals
and coralline macroalgae<sup>,</sup>, but
the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here
we report reduced calcite production at increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species,
the coccolithophorids <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i> and <i>Gephyrocapsa oceanica
</i>. This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths
and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in
the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results
were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north
Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels.
We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface
ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere,
the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on
atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
