Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by surface <i>Prochlorococcus</i> in the Atlantic Ocean
</title>
<description>
<p>Nearly half of the Earth’s surface is covered by the ocean populated by the most abundant photosynthetic organisms on the planet—<i>Prochlorococcus</i> cyanobacteria. However, in the oligotrophic open ocean, the majority of their cells in the top half of the photic layer have levels of photosynthetic pigmentation barely detectable by flow cytometry, suggesting low efficiency of CO<span>2</span> fixation compared with other phytoplankton living in the same waters. To test the latter assumption, CO<span>2</span> fixation rates of flow cytometrically sorted <sup>14</sup>C-labelled phytoplankton cells were directly compared in surface waters of the open Atlantic Ocean (30°S to 30°N). CO<span>2</span> fixation rates of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> are at least 1.5–2.0 times higher than CO<span>2</span> fixation rates of the smallest plastidic protists and <i>Synechococcus</i> cyanobacteria when normalised to photosynthetic pigmentation assessed using cellular red autofluorescence. Therefore, our data indicate that in oligotrophic oceanic surface waters, pigment minimisation allows <i>Prochlorococcus</i> cells to harvest plentiful sunlight more effectively than other phytoplankton.</p>
