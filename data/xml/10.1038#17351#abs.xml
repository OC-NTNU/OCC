Accelerated dissolution of diatom silica by marine bacterial assemblages
</title>
<description>
<p>Downward fluxes of biogenic silica and organic matter in the global ocean derive dominantly from the productivity of diatoms — phytoplankton with cell walls containing silica encased in an organic matrix<span></span>,<span></span>. As diatoms have an absolute requirement for silicon (as silicic acid)<span></span>, its supply into the photic zone — largely by silica dissolution and upwelling — controls diatom production (and consequently the biological uptake of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by the ocean) over vast oceanic areas<span></span>. Current biogeochemical models assume silica dissolution to be controlled by temperature, zooplankton grazing and diatom aggregation<span></span>,<span></span>, but the role of bacteria has not been established. Yet bacteria utilize about half of the organic matter derived from oceanic primary production<span></span> by varied strategies, including attack on dead and living diatoms by using hydrolytic enzymes<span></span>,<span></span>, and could adventitiously hasten silica dissolution by degrading the organic matrix which protects diatom frustules from dissolution<span></span>,<span></span>. Here we report the results of experiments in which natural assemblages of marine bacteria dramatically increased silica dissolution from two species of lysed marine diatoms compared to bacteria-free controls. Silica dissolution accompanied, and was caused by, bacterial colonization and hydrolytic attack. Bacteria-mediated silicon regeneration rates varied with diatom type and bacterial assemblage; observed rates could explain most of the reported upper-ocean silicon regeneration<span></span>,<span></span>. Bacteria-mediated silicon regeneration may thus critically control diatom productivity and the cycling and fate of silicon and carbon in the ocean.</p>
