Viral lysis of <i>Phaeocystis pouchetii</i>: Implications for algal population dynamics and heterotrophic C, N and P cycling
</title>
<description>
<p>A model ecosystem with two autotrophic flagellates, <i>Phaeocystis pouchetii</i> and <i>Rhodomonas salina</i>, a virus specific to <i>P. pouchetii</i> (PpV) and bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates was used to investigate effects of viral lysis on algal population dynamics and heterotrophic nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization. Lysis of <i>P. pouchetii</i> by PpV had strong positive effects on bacterial and HNF abundance, and the mass balance of C, N and P suggested an efficient transfer of organic material from <i>P. pouchetii</i> to bacterial and HNF biomass through viral lysis. At the same time, the degradation of <i>P. pouchetii</i> lysates was associated with significant regeneration of inorganic N and P resulting in 148 μg N l<sup>−1</sup> and 7 μg P l<sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to 78% and 26% of lysate N and P being mineralized to NH<span>4</span><sup>+</sup> and PO<span>4</span><sup>3−</sup>, respectively. These results showed that the turnover of viral lysates in the microbial food web was associated with significant N and P mineralization, supporting the current view that viral lysates can be an important source of inorganic nutrients in marine systems. In the presence of <i>R. salina</i>, the generated NH<span>4</span><sup>+</sup> supported 11% of the observed <i>R. salina</i> growth. Regrowth of virus-resistant <i>P. pouchetii</i> following cell lysis was observed in long-term incubations (150 days), and possibly influenced by nutrient availability and competition from <i>R. salina</i>. The observed impact of viral activity on autotrophic and heterotrophic processes provides direct experimental evidence for virus-driven nutrient generation and emphasizes the potential importance of the viral activity in supporting marine primary production.</p>
