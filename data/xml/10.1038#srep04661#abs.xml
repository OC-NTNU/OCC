Archaeal <i>amoA</i> and <i>ureC</i> genes and their transcriptional activity in the Arctic Ocean
</title>
<description>
<p><i>Thaumarchaeota</i> and the gene encoding for a subunit of ammonia monooxygenase (<i>amoA</i>) are ubiquitous in Polar Seas, and some <i>Thaumarchaeota</i> also have a gene coding for <i>ureC</i>, diagnostic for urease. Using quantitative PCR we investigated the occurrence of genes and transcripts of <i>ureC</i> and <i>amoA</i> in Arctic samples from winter, spring and summer. <i>AmoA</i> genes, <i>ureC</i> genes and <i>amoA</i> transcripts were always present, but <i>ureC</i> transcripts were rarely detected. Over a 48â€…h light manipulation experiment <i>amoA</i> transcripts persisted under light and dark conditions, but not <i>ureC</i> transcripts. In addition, maxima for <i>amoA</i> transcript were nearer the surface compared to <i>amoA</i> genes. Clone libraries using DNA template recovered shallow and deep <i>amoA</i> clades but only the shallow clade was recovered from cDNA (from RNA). These results imply environmental control of <i>amoA</i> expression with direct or indirect light effects, and rare <i>ureC</i> expression despite its widespread occurrence in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
