A microbial source of phosphonates in oligotrophic marine systems
</title>
<description>
<p>Phosphonates, compounds with a carbonâ€“phosphorus bond, are a key component of the marine dissolved organic phosphorus pool<span></span>. These compounds serve as a phosphorus source for primary producers, including the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria
<i>Trichodesmium</i><span></span>. Phosphonates can therefore support marine primary production, as well as climate-driven increases in marine nitrogen fixation<span></span>, carbon sequestration<span></span> and possibly methane production, through the breakdown of methylphosphonate<span></span>. Despite their importance, the source of phosphonates to the open ocean has remained uncertain. Here, we use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to screen for the presence of phosphonates in cultured strains of
<i>Trichodesmium erythraeum</i>. We show that phosphonates comprise an average of 10% of the cellular particulate phosphorus pool in this species. We therefore suggest that these cyanobacteria produce phosphonates, and might be a significant source of these compounds in the ocean, particularly in nutrient-poor regions, where <i>Trichodesmium</i> blooms occur. Given that <i>Trichodesmium</i> also thrives in a warm, carbon-dioxide-rich environment<span></span>, phosphonate production may increase in the future. This, in turn, might select for a microbial community that can use phosphonate, and could have implications for nitrogen fixation, carbon sequestration and greenhouse-gas production.</p>
