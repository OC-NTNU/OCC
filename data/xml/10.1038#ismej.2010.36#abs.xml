Significant CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by small prymnesiophytes in the subtropical and tropical northeast Atlantic Ocean
</title>
<description>
<p>Global estimates indicate the oceans are responsible for approximately half of the carbon dioxide fixed on Earth. Organisms 5 μm in size dominate open ocean phytoplankton communities in terms of abundance and CO<span>2</span> fixation, with the cyanobacterial genera <i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i> numerically the most abundant and more extensively studied compared with small eukaryotes. However, the contribution of specific taxonomic groups to marine CO<span>2</span> fixation is still poorly known. In this study, we show that among the phytoplankton, small eukaryotes contribute significantly to CO<span>2</span> fixation (44%) because of their larger cell volume and thereby higher cell-specific CO<span>2</span> fixation rates. Within the eukaryotes, two groups, herein called Euk-A and Euk-B, were distinguished based on their flow cytometric signature. Euk-A, the most abundant group, contained cells 1.8±0.1 μm in size while Euk-B was the least abundant but cells were larger (2.8±0.2 μm). The Euk-B group comprising prymnesiophytes (73±13%) belonging largely to lineages with no close cultured counterparts accounted for up to 38% of the total primary production in the subtropical and tropical northeast Atlantic Ocean, suggesting a key role of this group in oceanic CO<span>2</span> fixation.</p>
