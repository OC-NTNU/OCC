Effects of temperature on growth rate and gross growth efficiency of an Antarctic bacterivorous protist

<description>
<p>The effects of temperature on the growth rate and gross growth efficiency (GGE) of the heterotrophic nanoflagellate, <i>Paraphysomonas imperforata</i>, cultured from the Ross Sea, Antarctica were investigated using five experimental temperatures (range=0–20 °C). This bacterivorous protist exhibited measurable growth over the temperature range examined, although temperature exerted a significant effect on its growth rate. There was no evidence for an effect of temperature on GGE. The growth rates and GGE of our Antarctic <i>P. imperforata</i> isolate were compared to values reported for other cultures of species from this genus. A wide range of growth efficiencies have been reported for different strains of <i>Paraphysomonas</i> spp., but our estimates were comparable to mean/median values reported in the literature. The growth rates of our Antarctic <i>P. imperforata</i> were similar to rates obtained for an Arctic conspecific at low temperatures (0–5 °C), among the highest reported rates for any <i>Paraphysomonas</i> species at intermediate temperatures (10–15 °C) and similar to rates reported for temperate congeners and conspecifics at 20 °C. <i>Q</i><span>10</span> values of 15, 2.2, 3.6 and 0.93 were calculated for growth rates at 5 °C intervals between 0 and 20 °C, respectively. Results indicated that our Antarctic <i>P. imperforata</i> grew at rates comparable to other polar isolates at ambient polar temperatures, but these low temperatures may be outside the physiological optimum for the isolate.</p>
