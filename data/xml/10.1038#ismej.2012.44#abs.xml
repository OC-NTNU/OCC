Macrofauna regulate heterotrophic bacterial carbon and nitrogen incorporation in low-oxygen sediments

<description>
<p>Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) currently impinge upon >1 million km<sup>2</sup> of sea floor and are predicted to expand with climate change. We investigated how changes in oxygen availability, macrofaunal biomass and retention of labile organic matter (OM) regulate heterotrophic bacterial C and N incorporation in the sediments of the OMZ-impacted Indian continental margin (540–1100 m; [O<span>2</span>]=0.35–15 μmol l<sup>−1</sup>). <i>In situ</i> pulse-chase experiments traced <sup>13</sup>C:<sup>15</sup>N-labelled phytodetritus into bulk sediment OM and hydrolysable amino acids, including the bacterial biomarker <span>D</span>-alanine. Where oxygen availability was lowest ([O<span>2</span>]=0.35 μmol l<sup>−1</sup>), metazoan macrofauna were absent and bacteria assimilated 30–90% of the labelled phytodetritus within the sediment. At higher oxygen levels ([O<span>2</span>]=2–15 μmol l<sup>−1</sup>) the macrofaunal presence and lower phytodetritus retention with the sediment occur concomitantly, and bacterial phytodetrital incorporation was reduced and retarded. Bacterial C and N incorporation exhibited a significant negative relationship with macrofaunal biomass across the OMZ. We hypothesise that fauna–bacterial interactions significantly influence OM recycling in low-oxygen sediments and need to be considered when assessing the consequences of global change on biogeochemical cycles.</p>
