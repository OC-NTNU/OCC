Role of vertical mixing in controlling the oceanic <span>production</span> of dimethyl sulphide
</title>
<description>
<p>Marine microbiota are important for the global biogeochemical sulphur cycle, by making possible the transfer of reduced sulphur from the ocean to the atmosphere in the form of dimethyl sulphide<span></span>, DMS. Subsequent oxidation of DMS to acidic aerosols influences particle nucleation and growth over the oceans<span></span>, and so has the potential to influence radiative balance and global climate. It has been suggested<span></span> that this plankton–climate interaction is self-regulated, but tests of this hypothesis have remained elusive as little is known about the feedback effects of climate on the marine DMS cycle<span></span>. DMS is produced by enzymatic cleavage of the abundant algal component dimethylsulphoniopropionate<span></span> (DMSP), which suggests a high potential for DMS generation in the ocean. But there are competing processes<span></span> that utilize DMSP in the food web without producing DMS, and the external controls on these processes are unknown. Here we present data of DMSP consumption, DMS production and mixing-layer depths (which are driven by climate) in the subpolar North Atlantic, and compare these data with published results from other latitudes. We find evidence that the mixing-layer depth has a substantial influence on DMS yield in the short term. This finding, combined with the seasonal effect of vertical mixing on plankton succession and food-web structure, suggests that climate-controlled mixing controls DMS production over vast regions of the ocean.</p>
