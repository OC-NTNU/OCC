Gammaproteobacterial diazotrophs and <i>nifH</i> gene expression in surface waters of the South Pacific Ocean
</title>
<description>
<p>In addition to the cyanobacterial N<span>2</span>-fixers (diazotrophs), there is a high <i>nifH</i> gene diversity of non-cyanobacterial groups present in marine environments, yet quantitative information about these groups is scarce. N<span>2</span> fixation potential (<i>nifH</i> gene expression), diversity and distributions of the uncultivated diazotroph phylotype -24774A11, a putative gammaproteobacterium, were investigated in the western South Pacific Ocean. -24774A11 gene copies correlated positively with diazotrophic cyanobacteria, temperature, dissolved organic carbon and ambient O<span>2</span> saturation, and negatively with depth, chlorophyll <i>a</i> and nutrients, suggesting that carbon supply, access to light or inhibitory effects of DIN may control -24774A11 abundances. Maximum <i>nifH</i> gene-copy abundance was 2  10<sup>4</sup>l<sup>1</sup>, two orders of magnitude less than that for diazotrophic cyanobacteria, while the median -24774A11 abundance, 8  10<sup>2</sup>l<sup>1</sup>, was greater than that for the UCYN-A cyanobacteria, suggesting a more homogeneous distribution in surface waters. The abundance of <i>nifH</i> transcripts by -24774A11 was greater during the night than during the day, and the transcripts generally ranged from 07, but were up to 26 of all <i>nifH</i> transcripts at each station. The ubiquitous presence and low variability of -24774A11 abundances across tropical and subtropical oceans, combined with the consistent <i>nifH</i> expression reported in this study, suggest that -24774A11 could be one of the most important heterotrophic (or photoheterotrophic) diazotrophs and may need to be considered in future N budget estimates and models.</p>
