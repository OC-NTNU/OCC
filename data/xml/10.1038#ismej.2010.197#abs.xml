Contribution of crenarchaeal autotrophic ammonia oxidizers to the dark <span>primary</span> <span>production</span> in Tyrrhenian deep waters (Central Mediterranean Sea)

<description>
<p>Mesophilic <i>Crenarchaeota</i> have recently been thought to be significant contributors to nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycling. In this study, we examined the vertical distribution of ammonia-oxidizing <i>Crenarchaeota</i> at offshore site in Southern Tyrrhenian Sea. The median value of the crenachaeal cell to <i>amoA</i> gene ratio was close to one suggesting that virtually all deep-sea <i>Crenarchaeota</i> possess the capacity to oxidize ammonia. Crenarchaea-specific genes, <i>nir</i>K and <i>ure</i>C, for nitrite reductase and urease were identified and their affiliation demonstrated the presence of ‘deep-sea’ clades distinct from ‘shallow’ representatives. Measured deep-sea dark CO<span>2</span> fixation estimates were comparable to the median value of photosynthetic biomass production calculated for this area of Tyrrhenian Sea, pointing to the significance of this process in the C cycle of aphotic marine ecosystems. To elucidate the pivotal organisms in this process, we targeted known marine crenarchaeal autotrophy-related genes, coding for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<i>acc</i>A) and 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase (4-<i>hbd</i>). As in case of <i>nir</i>K and <i>ure</i>C, these genes are grouped with deep-sea sequences being distantly related to those retrieved from the epipelagic zone. To pair the molecular data with specific functional attributes we performed [<sup>14</sup>C]HCO<span>3</span> incorporation experiments followed by analyses of radiolabeled proteins using shotgun proteomics approach. More than 100 oligopeptides were attributed to 40 marine crenarchaeal-specific proteins that are involved in 10 different metabolic processes, including autotrophy. Obtained results provided a clear proof of chemolithoautotrophic physiology of bathypelagic crenarchaeota and indicated that this numerically predominant group of microorganisms facilitate a hitherto unrecognized sink for inorganic C of a global importance.</p>
