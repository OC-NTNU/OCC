Although phytoplankton are the major source of marine dissolved organic matter (DOM), their blooms are a global problem that can greatly affect marine ecological systems, especially free-living bacteria, which are the primary DOM degraders.
In this study, we analyzed free-living bacterial communities from Xiamen sea during an Akashiwo sanguine bloom using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons.
The bloom was probably stimulated by low salinity and ended after abatement of eutrophication pollution.
A total of 658,446 sequence reads and 11,807 OTUs were obtained in both bloom and control samples with Alpha-proteobacteria and Gamma-proteobacteria being the predominant classes detected.
The bloom decreased bacterial diversity, increased species evenness, and significantly changed the bacterial community structure.
Bacterial communities within the bloom were more homogeneous than those within the control area.
The bacteria stimulated by this bloom included the SAR86 and SAR116 clades and the AEGEAN-169 marine group, but a few were suppressed.
In addition, many bacteria known to be associated with phytoplankton were detected only in the bloom samples.
This study revealed the great influence of an A. sanguinea bloom on free-living bacterial communities, and provided new insights into the relationship between bacteria and A. sanguinea in marine ecosystems.
