Ecogenomic sensor reveals controls on N<sub>2</sub>-fixing microorganisms in the North Pacific Ocean
</title>
<description>
<p>Nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) are keystone species that reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N<span>2</span>) gas to fixed nitrogen (N), thereby accounting for much of N-based new production annually in the oligotrophic North Pacific. However, current approaches to study N<span>2</span> fixation provide relatively limited spatiotemporal sampling resolution; hence, little is known about the ecological controls on these microorganisms or the scales over which they change. In the present study, we used a drifting robotic gene sensor to obtain high-resolution data on the distributions and abundances of N<span>2</span>-fixing populations over small spatiotemporal scales. The resulting measurements demonstrate that concentrations of N<span>2</span> fixers can be highly variable, changing in abundance by nearly three orders of magnitude in less than 2 days and 30â€‰km. Concurrent shipboard measurements and long-term time-series sampling uncovered a striking and previously unrecognized correlation between phosphate, which is undergoing long-term change in the region, and N<span>2</span>-fixing cyanobacterial abundances. These results underscore the value of high-resolution sampling and its applications for modeling the effects of global change.</p>
