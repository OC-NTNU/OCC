Rapid and early export of <i>Phaeocystis antarctica</i> blooms in the
Ross Sea, Antarctica

<p>The Southern Ocean is very important for the potential sequestration of
carbon dioxide in the oceans<span></span> and is expected to be vulnerable
to changes in carbon export forced by anthropogenic climate warming<span></span>.
Annual phytoplankton blooms in seasonal ice zones are highly productive and
are thought to contribute significantly to pCO<sub>2</sub> drawdown in the
Southern Ocean. Diatoms are assumed to be the most important phytoplankton
class with respect to export production in the Southern Ocean; however, the
colonial prymnesiophyte <i>Phaeocystis antarctica</i> regularly forms huge
blooms in seasonal ice zones and coastal Antarctic waters<span></span>.
There is little evidence regarding the fate of carbon produced by <i>P. antarctica
</i> in the Southern Ocean, although remineralization in the upper water column
has been proposed to be the main pathway in polar waters<span></span>.
Here we present evidence for early and rapid carbon export from <i>P. antarctica
</i> blooms to deep water and sediments in the Ross Sea. Carbon sequestration
from <i>P. antarctica</i> blooms may influence the carbon cycle in the Southern
Ocean, especially if projected climatic changes lead to an alteration in the
structure of the phytoplankton community<span></span>.</p>
