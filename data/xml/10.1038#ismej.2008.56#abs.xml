Seasonal dynamics of the endosymbiotic, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium <i>Richelia intracellularis</i> in the eastern Mediterranean Sea

<p>Biological nitrogen fixation has been suggested as an important source of nitrogen for the ultra-oligotrophic waters of the Levantine Basin of the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, we identify and characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the N-fixing (diazotrophic) cyanobacterium <i>Richelia intracellularis</i>. <i>R. intracellularis</i> is usually found as an endosymbiont within diatoms such as <i>Rhizosolenia</i> spp and <i>Hemiaulus</i> spp. and is an important diazotroph in marine tropical oceans. In this study, two stations off the Mediterranean coast of Israel were sampled monthly during 2005–2007. <i>R. intracellularis</i> was identified by microscopy and by reverse transcribed-PCR which confirmed a 98.8% identity with known <i>nifH</i> sequences of <i>R. intracellularis</i> from around the world. The diatom–diazotroph associations were found throughout the year peaking during autumn (October–November) at both stations. Abundance of <i>R. intracellularis</i> ranged from 10 to 55 heterocysts l<sup>−1</sup> and correlated positively with the dissolved Si(OH)<span>4</span>/(NO<span>3</span>+NO<span>2</span>) ratio in surface waters. Although the rates of nitrogen fixation were very low, averaging ∼1.1 nmol N l<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> for the <i>R. intracellularis</i> size fraction (>10 μm) from surface waters, they correlated positively with heterocyst counts during thermal stratification. The lack of large-scale diatom–diazotroph blooms and the low rates of nitrogen fixation by these diazotrophs may result from the P-starved conditions affecting the Levantine basin.</p>
