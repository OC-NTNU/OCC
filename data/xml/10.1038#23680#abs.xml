Competition among marine <span>phytoplankton</span> for different chelated iron species
</title>
<description>
<p>Dissolved-iron availability plays a critical role in controlling phytoplankton growth in the oceans<span></span>,<span></span>. The dissolved iron is overwhelmingly (âˆ¼99%) bound to organic ligands with a very high affinity for iron<span></span>, but the origin, chemical identity and biological availability of this organically complexed Fe is largely unknown<span></span>. The release into sea water of complexes that strongly chelate iron could result from the inducible iron-uptake systems of prokaryotes (siderophore complexes)<span></span> or by processes such as zooplankton-mediated degradation and release of intracellular material (porphyrin complexes). Here we compare the uptake of siderophore- and porphyrin-complexed <span>55</span>Fe by phytoplankton, using both cultured organisms and natural assemblages. Eukaryotic phytoplankton efficiently assimilate porphyrin-complexed iron, but this iron source is relatively unavailable to prokaryotic picoplankton (cyanobacteria). In contrast, iron bound to a variety of siderophores is relatively more available to cyanobacteria than to eukaryotes, suggesting that the two plankton groups exhibit fundamentally different iron-uptake strategies. Prokaryotes utilize iron complexed to either endogenous<span></span> or exogenous siderophores<span></span>, whereas eukaryotes may rely on a ferrireductase system<span></span>,<span></span> that preferentially accesses iron chelated by tetradentate porphyrins, rather than by hexadentate siderophores. Competition between prokaryotes and eukaryotes for organically-bound iron may therefore depend on the chemical nature of available iron complexes, with consequences for ecological niche separation, plankton community size-structure and carbon export in low-iron waters.</p>
