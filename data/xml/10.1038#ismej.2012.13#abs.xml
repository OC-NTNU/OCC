Molecular evidence of iron limitation and availability in the global diazotroph <i>Trichodesmium</i>
</title>
<description>
<p>The activity of the N<span>2</span>-fixing cyanobacterial genus <i>Trichodesmium</i> is critical to the global nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles. Although iron (Fe) has been shown to be an important element limiting the growth and N<span>2</span> fixation of <i>Trichodesmium</i>, there have been no specific data demonstrating the <i>in situ</i> affect of Fe on <i>Trichodesmium</i>. We surveyed <i>Trichodesmium</i> populations from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans for Fe limitation using a novel quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) method monitoring the expression of an Fe limitation-induced gene, <i>isiB</i>. Here we report the first molecular evidence of <i>in situ</i> Fe limitation of <i>Trichodesmium</i> N<span>2</span> fixation, which was evident in samples from the Pacific Ocean, whereas limitation appeared minimal to nonexistent in Atlantic Ocean samples. As our method is <i>Trichodesmium</i> clade specific, we were also able to determine that representatives from the <i>Trichodesmium tenue</i> clade were the most biologically active group of <i>Trichodesmium</i> in the majority of our samples, which speaks to their dominance in open ocean regimes. Furthermore, comparisons of our field expression and chemical data with laboratory studies suggest that the majority of dissolved Fe in the open ocean is available to <i>Trichodesmium</i> colonies regardless of Fe complexation.</p>
