Variation in plastic responses of a globally distributed picoplankton species to ocean acidification
</title>
<description>
<p>Phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, and affect biogeochemical cycles. As CO<sub>2</sub> levels increase, shifts in the frequencies and physiology of ecotypes within phytoplankton groups will affect their nutritional value and biogeochemical function. However, studies so far are based on a few representative genotypes from key species. Here, we measure changes in cellular function and growth rate at atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations predicted for the year 2100 in 16 ecotypes of the marine picoplankton
<i>Ostreococcus</i>. We find that variation in plastic responses among ecotypes is on par with published between-genera variation, so the responses of one or a few ecotypes cannot estimate changes to the physiology or composition of a species under CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. We show that ecotypes best at taking advantage of CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment by changing their photosynthesis rates most should increase in relative fitness, and so in frequency in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> environment. Finally, information on sampling location, and not phylogenetic relatedness, is a good predictor of ecotypes likely to increase in frequency in this system.</p>
