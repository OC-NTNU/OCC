        <text>To better understand the temporal and spatial dynamics of Prochlorococcus populations, and how these populations co-vary with the physical environment, we followed monthly changes in the abundance of five ecotypes--two high-light adapted and three low-light adapted--over a 5-year period in coordination with the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) and Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) programs.

        <text>Ecotype abundance displayed weak seasonal fluctuations at HOT and strong seasonal fluctuations at BATS.

        <text>Furthermore, stable 'layered' depth distributions, where different Prochlorococcus ecotypes reached maximum abundance at different depths, were maintained consistently for 5 years at HOT.

        <text>Layered distributions were also observed at BATS, although winter deep mixing events disrupted these patterns each year and produced large variations in ecotype abundance.

        <text>Interestingly, the layered ecotype distributions were regularly reestablished each year after deep mixing subsided at BATS.

        <text>In addition, Prochlorococcus ecotypes each responded differently to the strong seasonal changes in light, temperature and mixing at BATS, resulting in a reproducible annual succession of ecotype blooms.

        <text>Patterns of ecotype abundance, in combination with physiological assays of cultured isolates, confirmed that the low-light adapted eNATL could be distinguished from other low-light adapted ecotypes based on its ability to withstand temporary exposure to high-intensity light, a characteristic stress of the surface mixed layer.

        <text>Finally, total Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus dynamics were compared with similar time series data collected a decade earlier at each location.

        <text>The two data sets were remarkably similar--testimony to the resilience of these complex dynamic systems on decadal time scales.
