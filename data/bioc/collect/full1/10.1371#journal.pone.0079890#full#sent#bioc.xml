        <text>However, a possible appearance of Synedropsis in phytoplankton assemblages or incubation experiments might have been overlooked in past studies, as their delicately silicified frustules are very prone to dissolution [61] and not distinguishable from Pseudo-nitzschia by light microscopy (Figure 4).
