        <text>The addition of iron to high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions induces phytoplankton blooms that take up carbon.

        <text>Carbon export from the surface layer and, in particular, the ability of the ocean and sediments to sequester carbon for many years remains, however, poorly quantified.

        <text>Here we report data from the CROZEX experiment in the Southern Ocean, which was conducted to test the hypothesis that the observed north-south gradient in phytoplankton concentrations in the vicinity of the Crozet Islands is induced by natural iron fertilization that results in enhanced organic carbon flux to the deep ocean.

        <text>We report annual particulate carbon fluxes out of the surface layer, at three kilometres below the ocean surface and to the ocean floor.

        <text>We find that carbon fluxes from a highly productive, naturally iron-fertilized region of the sub-Antarctic Southern Ocean are two to three times larger than the carbon fluxes from an adjacent high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll area not fertilized by iron.

        <text>Our findings support the hypothesis that increased iron supply to the glacial sub-Antarctic may have directly enhanced carbon export to the deep ocean.

        <text>The CROZEX sequestration efficiency (the amount of carbon sequestered below the depth of winter mixing for a given iron supply) of 8,600 mol mol-1 was 18 times greater than that of a phytoplankton bloom induced artificially by adding iron, but 77 times smaller than that of another bloom initiated, like CROZEX, by a natural supply of iron.

        <text>Large losses of purposefully added iron can explain the lower efficiency of the induced bloom6.

        <text>The discrepancy between the blooms naturally supplied with iron may result in part from an underestimate of horizontal iron supply.
