        <text>Microbial activities that affect global oceanographic and atmospheric processes happen throughout the water column, yet the long-term ecological dynamics of microbes have been studied largely in the euphotic zone and adjacent seasonally mixed depths.

        <text>We investigated temporal patterns in the community structure of free-living bacteria, by sampling approximately monthly from 5 m, the deep chlorophyll maximum (~15-40 m), 150, 500 and 890 m, in San Pedro Channel (maximum depth 900 m, hypoxic below ~500 m), off the coast of Southern California.

        <text>Community structure and biodiversity (inverse Simpson index) showed seasonal patterns near the surface and bottom of the water column, but not at intermediate depths.

        <text>Inverse Simpson's index was highest in the winter in surface waters and in the spring at 890 m, and varied interannually at all depths.

        <text>Biodiversity appeared to be driven partially by exchange of microbes between depths and was highest when communities were changing slowly over time.

        <text>After accounting for seasonality, several environmental parameters co-varied with community structure at the surface and 890 m, but not at the intermediate depths.

        <text>Abundant and seasonally variable groups included, at 890 m, Nitrospina, Flavobacteria and Marine Group A. Seasonality at 890 m is likely driven by variability in sinking particles, which originate in surface waters, pass transiently through the middle water column and accumulate on the seafloor where they alter the chemical environment.

        <text>This surface-to-bottom, decade-long, study identifies seasonality and interannual variability not only of overall community structure, but also of numerous taxonomic groups and near-species level operational taxonomic units.
